I'm part of Walmart Edge foundation team and Currently working on T1 Proxy. 

I am a key contributor to the development of an asynchronous asset optimization pipeline â€” A Distributed system designed to optimize static asset which helped in significantly improving webpage load times and overall end-user satisfaction.

**Key Contributions:**
- I led the scaling effort of our optimization pipeline, enabling it to efficiently handle over 500 million assets. This involved architectural enhancements and performance tuning to accommodate extreme concurrent throughput.
- I contributed to the development of a robust Redis-based job queueing system, capable of handling more than 200,000 jobs per minute. This system ensures efficient asset processing and timely optimization.
- Collaboratively, I played a crucial role in improving core web vitals, delivering a better user experience by optimizing loading times and critical web performance metrics.
- I implemented regression tests for our optimization pipeline, utilizing the Ginkgo framework. This initiative resulted in a more reliable and faster release cycle.
- To streamline our deployment processes, I automated them using Concord and Ansible, simplifying and expediting deployment tasks.

My experience at GoJek has been instrumental in honing my skills and contributing to the success of critical projects, including:

**GoFood Merchant Order System:**
- Designed and implemented multiple APIs to empower food merchants with real-time order details, enhancing their operational efficiency.
- Led user requirement analysis, design, and programming efforts to improve merchant experience, like build MQTT message broker-based order updates for faster communication instead of using a polling system.
- Spearheaded the design and development of a system architecture that prompts merchants to initiate food preparation when drivers are nearby, optimizing order fulfillment.
- Architected a compensation system within the merchant app, allowing merchants to raise compensation requests for order cancellations not attributable to them.

**GoFood Order Management System:**
- Played a pivotal role in developing highly available background workers, supported by Redis Sentinel, ensuring reliable order fulfillment and delivery.
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration management for high-availability workers using Terraform and Chef, streamlining system maintenance.
- Successfully integrated our system with multiple third-party services, improving interoperability and expanding our service offerings.
- Contributed to the development of various business-specific features, enriching the GoFood ecosystem with enhanced functionality.

These experiences have honed my skills in system architecture, API design, automation, and cross-functional collaboration, enabling me to make valuable contributions to complex projects
